# 对抗攻防论文（NeurIPS2022）

NeurIPS 2022 关于对抗攻防/AI安全相关的论文整理。自认为还是比较全，但重点是偏向对抗攻防，因此用AI进行传统安全分析的论文或许没有在本清单中。

随谈：

1. ***Keywords***和***TL;DR***来源：原作者/审稿评论/论文摘要/个人总结。为了避免翻译错误，以及减少工作量，全部都采用英文。

2. 关于类别，有些文章隶属于多个类别，为了避免重复，按照个人理解归为了某类。

3. 扩展阅读：很多方向都跟对抗攻防具有较高地相关性，如反事实解释（Counterfactual Explanations），虚假关联（Spurious Correlations）。因此适当看些其他领域的论文也很有必要。

4. 物理攻击研究的难点之一是实验成本高昂，但这两年神经辐射场（Newral Radiance Fields, NeRF）用于3D渲染的效果很好，大量研究者在研究。这也给物理攻击的仿真带来了新工具，或许物理世界的攻防研究会变轻松些。

5. NeurIPS上防御的文章接近80篇左右，攻击是40篇左右。可见防御的热度高于攻击，这也是AI安全研究的终极目的，提示AI安全性、可靠性。

6. 对抗攻防以及发展许多年了，最近也出了一些评估系统的研究。学术界、工业界都在尝试搭建一个完善的模型评估、防范系统。部分如下：

Shengming Yuan, Qilong Zhang, Lianli Gao, Yaya Cheng, Jingkuan Song

***Keywords:*** unrestricted color attack, transferability, flexible, natural, semantic-based, unrestricted attack

* **[Decision-based Black-box Attack Against Vision Transformers via Patch-wise Adversarial Removal ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CwQCeJnteii)**

Yucheng Shi, Yahong Han, Yu-an Tan, Xiaohui Kuang

***Keywords:*** Adversarial attack, Black-box attack, Decision-based attack, Vision transformer

***TL;DR:*** This paper proposes a new decision-based black-box adversarial attack against ViTs with theoretical analysis that divides images into patches through a coarse-to-fine search process and compresses the noise on each patch separately.

* **[Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks with Reverse Adversarial Perturbation ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=k5uFiFLWv3X)**

Zeyu Qin, Yanbo Fan, Yi Liu, Li Shen, Yong Zhang, Jue Wang, Baoyuan Wu

***Keywords:*** Adversarial Transferability, Black-Box Attacks, Adversarial Examples

***TL;DR:*** The authors claim that the adversarial examples should be in a flat local region for better transferability. To boost the transferability, they propose a simple yet effective method named Reverse Adversarial Perturbation (RAP). RAP adds an inner optimization to help the attack escape sharp local minima, which is general to other attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of RAP.

* **[Blackbox Attacks via Surrogate Ensemble Search ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lSfrwyww-FR)**

Zikui Cai, Chengyu Song, Srikanth Krishnamurthy, Amit Roy-Chowdhury, M. Salman Asif

***Keywords:*** surrogate ensemble, bilevel optimization, limited query attacks, surrogate ensemble, hard-label attacks, query attack, 

***TL;DR:*** Optimizing a weighted loss function over surrogate ensemble provides highly successful and query efficient blackbox (targeted and untargeted) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for Blackbox Attacks via Surrogate Ensemble Search (BASES) that can generate highly successful blackbox attacks using an extremely small number of queries.

* **[Towards Lightweight Black-Box Attack Against Deep Neural Networks ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Gpqqm4p91Ez)**

Yunrui Yu, Xitong Gao, Cheng-zhong Xu

***Keywords:*** adversarial attack, ensemble adversarial defense, model robustness, model ensemble, ensemble attack

***TL;DR:*** Re-weighing sub-models in various ensemble defenses can lead to attacks with much faster convergence and higher success rates. The main idea is to assign different weights to different models.

* **[GAMA: Generative Adversarial Multi-Object Scene Attacks ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=DRckHIGk8qw)**

## 后门攻击/数据投毒(Backdoor, Data Poisoning)（9）

后门攻击依旧很多文章进行研究，但内部也细分了很多小小方向了，如在数据上操作，在模型参数上操作。攻击的目的也有破坏分类器性能，保障数据版权/模型版权等

* **[Autoregressive Perturbations for Data Poisoning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1vusesyN7E)**

Pedro Sandoval-Segura, Vasu Singla, Jonas Geiping, Micah Goldblum, Tom Goldstein, David W. Jacobs

***Keywords:*** autoregressive processes, poisons, data poisoning, data protection, imperceptible perturbations, adversarial machine learning

***TL;DR:*** This paper proposes a new data poisoning attack to prevent data scraping. The proposed method adds class conditional autoregressive (AR) noise to training data to prevent people from using the data for training, and the method is data and model independent, which means that the same noise can be used to poison different datasets and models of different architectures.

* **[Marksman Backdoor: Backdoor Attacks with Arbitrary Target Class ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=i-k6J4VkCDq)**

Khoa D Doan, Yingjie Lao, Ping Li

***Keywords:*** arbitrary trigger, backdoor attacks, generative models

***TL;DR:*** Backdoor Attacks with Arbitrary Target Class

* **[Can Adversarial Training Be Manipulated By Non-Robust Features? ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TVlKuUk-uj9)**

Lue Tao, Lei Feng, Hongxin Wei, Jinfeng Yi, Sheng-Jun Huang, Songcan Chen

***Keywords:*** Adversarial Training, Adversarial Robustness, Availability Attacks, Hypocritical Perturbations

***TL;DR:*** Adversarial training may fail to provide test robustness under stability attacks, and thus an adaptive defense is necessary to resolve this issue.
This paper introduces a novel data poisoning attack against adversarial training called stability attacks. The goal is to temper the training data such that the robust performance of adversarial training over this manipulated dataset is degraded. To construct this attack, a hypocritical perturbation is built: unlike adversarial perturbations, the aim of hypocritical perturbations is to reinforce the non-robust features in the training data. These perturbations can be generated by negating adversarial example generation objectives.

* **[Sleeper Agent: Scalable Hidden Trigger Backdoors for Neural Networks Trained from Scratch ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=p0LJa6_XHM_)**

***TL;DR:*** This paper conducts a study on the vulnerability of the continuous prompt learning algorithm to backdoor attacks. The authors have made a few interesting observations, such as that the few-shot scenario poses challenge to backdoor attacks. The authors then propose BadPrompt for backdoor attacking continuous prompts. 

* **[Amplifying Membership Exposure via Data Poisoning ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mT18WLu9J_)**

Yufei Chen, Chao Shen, Yun Shen, Cong Wang, Yang Zhang

***Keywords:*** Data poisoning, membership inference, data privacy

***TL;DR:*** We demonstrate how to use data poisoning attacks to amplify the membership exposure of the targeted class.

* **[Lethal Dose Conjecture on Data Poisoning ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PYnSpt3jAz)**

Wenxiao Wang, Alexander Levine, Soheil Feizi

***Keywords:*** data poisoning, robustness, theory, security

***TL;DR:*** We propose Lethal Dose Conjecture, which characterizes the largest amount of poisoned samples any defense can tolerate for a given task, and showcase its implications, including better/easy ways to improve robustness against data poisoning. (This paper suggests a hypothesis for the necessary and sufficient amount of malicious samples needed asymptotically for successful data poisoning. Most notably, the amount is inversely proportional to the minimum amount of data needed to learn the concept for the chose model class. )

## 对抗重编程(Adversarial Reprogramming)(3)

传统对抗样本目的是使模型分类错误，对抗重编程则是使模型执行特定任务（该任务可以是有害方面，跑第三方任务，也可以是有利方面，如提升分布外检测性能，提升模型公平性），且该任务可以未被训练过。

* **[Adversarial Reprogramming Revisited ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=F0wPem89q9y)**

Matthias Englert, Ranko Lazic

## 隐私相关（对抗攻防）(9)

主要是对抗攻防相关的，因此几乎没有包括联邦学习等隐私相关方向的论文。

### 联邦学习(Federated Learning)

* **[Learning to Attack Federated Learning: A Model-based Reinforcement Learning Attack Framework ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=4OHRr7gmhd4)**

Henger Li, Xiaolin Sun, Zizhan Zheng

***Keywords:*** Federated Learning, Adversarial Attacks, Reinforcement Learning, Data Poisoning Attacks

***TL;DR:*** We propose a model-based reinforcement learning framework to derive untargeted poisoning attacks against federated learning (FL) systems. 

### 成员推理攻击(Membership Inference Attacks )

成员推理攻击是指给定数据记录和模型的黑盒访问权限，判断该记录是否在模型的训练数据集中。

* **[Parameters or Privacy: A Provable Tradeoff Between Overparameterization and Membership Inference ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7nypt7cjNL)**

Jasper Tan, Blake Mason, Hamid Javadi, Richard Baraniuk

***Keywords:*** Membership inference, Privacy, Linear Regression, Overparameterization

***TL;DR:*** We prove that increasing the number of parameters of a linear model increases its vulnerability to membership inference attacks. 

* **[MExMI: Pool-based Active Model Extraction Crossover Membership Inference ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=o8H6h13Avjy)**

Yaxin Xiao, Qingqing Ye, Haibo Hu, Huadi Zheng, Chengfang Fang, Jie Shi

***Keywords:*** AI Safety, Model Extraction attack, Membership Inference attack

***TL;DR:*** This work explores a chained and iterative reaction where model extraction and membership inference advance each other. (This paper studies the problem of securing a model once it is published as a service. In most prior studies the focus was on either protecting the model from extraction attacks (ME) or from identifying the data used for training the model (MI). The authors propose that a simultaneous attack on both surfaces is even more powerful since the MI attack provides more information to the ME attack.)

* **[M^4I: Multi-modal Models Membership Inference ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2GsQ8dyfe45)**

Pingyi Hu, Zihan Wang, Ruoxi Sun, Hu Wang, Minhui Xue

***Keywords:*** Membership inference attack, Data privacy leakage, Multimodality

***TL;DR:*** The paper studies the privacy leakage of multi-modal models, proposing a membership inference attack against multi-modal models. Two attack methods are introduced, the metric-based M4I and the feature-based M4I. In metric-based M4I, the adversary can score the data and use a threshold or a binary classifier to distinguish between the scores of member data and non-member data; while in feature-based M4I, a pre-trained shadow multi-modal feature extractor is used to conduct data inference attack.

### 模型反演攻击(Model Inversion Attacks)

模型逆向(反演)攻击(model inversion attack)利用机器学习系统提供的一些API来获取模型的一些初步信息，并通过这些初步信息对模型进行逆向分析，获取模型内部的一些隐私数据。这种攻击和成员推理攻击的区别是，成员推理攻击是针对某一条单一的训练数据，而模型逆向攻击则是倾向于取得某个程度的统计信息。

* **[Measuring Data Reconstruction Defenses in Collaborative Inference Systems ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UMdY6-r7yRu)**

Mengda Yang, Ziang Li, Juan Wang, Hongxin Hu, Ao Ren, Xiaoyang Xu, Wenzhe Yi

***Keywords:*** model inversion attack, edge-cloud learning 

***TL;DR:*** The paper presents a new model inversion attack for edge-cloud learning which is shown to overcome existing defenses against model inversion in such scenario. The attack is based on Sensitive Feature Distillation (SFD) which simultaneously uses two existing techniques, shadow model and feature-based knowledge distillation. The authors claim that the proposed attack method can effectively extract the purified feature map from the intentionally obfuscated one and recover the private image for popular image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA.


* **[Reconstructing Training Data From Trained Neural Networks ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sxk8Bse3RKO)**

Niv Haim, Gal Vardi, Gilad Yehudai, michal Irani, Ohad Shamir

***Keywords:*** implicit bias, dataset reconstruction, privacy attacks, model inversion attack

***TL;DR:*** We provide a novel scheme for reconstructing large portions of the actual training samples from a trained neural network. Our scheme is inspired by recent theoretical results of the implicit bias in training neural networks.

### 模型隐写

* **[House of Cans: Covert Transmission of Internal Datasets via Capacity-Aware Neuron Steganography ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iAktFMVfeff)**

Xudong Pan, Shengyao Zhang, Mi Zhang, Yifan Yan, Min Yang

***Keywords:*** data stealing, deep learning privacy, AI security

***TL;DR:*** This paper presents a method called Cans for encoding secret datasets into deep neural networks (DNNs) and transmitting them in a openly shared “carrier” DNN. In contrast to existing steganography methods encoding information into least significant bits, the authors encode the secret dataset into a trained publicly shared DNN model such that the public model will predict weights for secret key inputs (known to covert operatives), the weights are used to populate a secret DNN model and the secret DNN model predicts secret dataset for noisy inputs (known to covert operatives). The main advantage of the Cans encoding is that it can covertly transmit over 10000 real-world data samples within a carrier model which has 100× less parameters than the total size of the stolen data, and simultaneously transmit multiple heterogeneous datasets within a single carrier model, under a trivial distortion rate (< 10−5) and with almost no utility loss on the carrier model (< 1%).

### 差分隐私(Differential Privacy)

* **[In Differential Privacy, There is Truth: on Vote-Histogram Leakage in Ensemble Private Learning ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=a3ymtHbL5p5)**

Jiaqi Wang, Roei Schuster, Ilia Shumailov, David Lie, Nicolas Papernot

***Keywords:*** adversarial, differential privacy, privacy, attacks

***TL;DR:*** We show that the differrential privacy mechanism used to protect training sets in ensemble-based decentralized learning, in fact causes leakage of sensitive information.

### 虚假关联(Spurious Correlations)

建立虚假关联，使得数据无法被用于训练，从而保护隐私。有个专门研究虚假关联的方向。

* **[ConfounderGAN: Protecting Image Data Privacy with Causal Confounder ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XxmOKCt8dO9)**

Qi Tian, Kun Kuang, Kelu Jiang, Furui Liu, Zhihua Wang, Fei Wu

***Keywords:*** data privacy, generative adversarial network, causal confounder

***TL;DR:*** We propose a causality inspired method, named ConfounderGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) to make personal image data unlearnable for protecting the data privacy of its owners.

## 攻击下游任务

### 攻击预训练模型

* **[Pre-trained Adversarial Perturbations ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZLcwSgV-WKH)**

Yuanhao Ban, Yinpeng Dong

***Keywords:*** Adversarial samples, pre-trained models, security

***TL;DR:*** We design a novel algorithm to generate adversarial samples using pre-trained models which can fool the corresponding fine-tuned ones and thus reveal the safety problem of fine-tuning pre-trained models to do downstream tasks.
本文为预先训练的模型开发了一种攻击方法，因此即使对于下游任务，攻击也可以保持有效。

### 图像质量评估(Image Quality Assessment, IQA)

* **[Perceptual Attacks of No-Reference Image Quality Models with Human-in-the-Loop ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3AV_53iRfTi)**

Weixia Zhang, Dingquan Li, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai, Guodong Guo, Xiaokang Yang, Kede Ma

***Keywords:*** Adversarial attack, Image Quality

***TL;DR:*** This paper builds upon work from several fields (adversarial attacks, MAD competition, and Eigen-distortion analysis) which are analysis by synthesis methods used to generate small magnitude perturbations (by some pixel measure) that cause large change in model response (either in classification for adversarial attacks, or perceptual distance in MAD and Eigen-distortion). The paper extends this to the field of no-reference image quality metrics, and compares their contribution with these other methods. They successfully use this method to synthesize images that change the NR-IQA quality score significantly but are below human detection (with humans in the loop).

### 攻击人脸识别(Face Recognition)

* **[Adv-Attribute: Inconspicuous and Transferable Adversarial Attack on Face Recognition ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d229wqASHOT)**

Shuai Jia, Bangjie Yin, Taiping Yao, Shouhong Ding, Chunhua Shen, Xiaokang Yang, Chao Ma

***Keywords:*** adversarial attack, face recognition, unrestricted attack

***TL;DR:*** This paper studied the inconspicuous and transferable adversarial attacks on face recognition models. Different from previous works that consider  norm perturbations, this paper introduces the framework of adversarial attributes, which generates noise on the attribute space of face images based on StyleGAN. An importance-aware attribute selection approach is proposed to ensure the stealthiness and attacking performance. The experiments on various face models show the effectiveness.

## 攻击其他种类模型

### 扩散模型(Diffusion Models)

* **[Diffusion Visual Counterfactual Explanations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7SEi-ISNni7)**

Maximilian Augustin, Valentyn Boreiko, Francesco Croce, Matthias Hein

***Keywords:*** Diffusion Models, Counterfactual, Visual Counterfactual Explanations

***TL;DR:*** This paper focus on generating Visual Counterfactual Explanations (VCE) for any arbitrary classifier using diffusion models. This work leverages diffusion models to generate realistic and minimal semantically altered VCE examples.

### 推荐系统(Recommender Systems)

* **[Revisiting Injective Attacks on Recommender Systems ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=e5HTq2VA7mu)**

Haoyang LI, Shimin Di, Lei Chen

***Keywords:*** Recommender system, Injective Attacks, Poisoning Attack

***TL;DR:*** We first revisit current injective attackers on recommender systems and then propose a difficulty-aware and diversity-aware attacker.
引流攻击，有点意思

### 音频攻击

* **[VoiceBlock: Privacy through Real-Time Adversarial Attacks with Audio-to-Audio Models ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8gQEmEgWAkc)**

Patrick O'Reilly, Andreas Bugler, Keshav Bhandari, Max Morrison, Bryan Pardo

***Keywords:*** privacy, adversarial examples, speech, speaker recognition

***TL;DR:*** This paper presents VoiceBox, an adversarial audio attack which (1) dramatically lowers the accuracy of speaker recognition systems, (2) is mostly imperceptible to humans, and (3) can operate in real-time on live audio streams. The authors further demonstrate that their proposed model may also transfer to speaker recognition systems that it was not explicitly trained to fool.

### 图神经网络(Graph Neural Networks, GNN)

* **[Are Defenses for Graph Neural Networks Robust? ](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yCJVkELVT9d)**

Felix Mujkanovic, Simon Geisler, Stephan Günnemann, Aleksandar Bojchevski

***Keywords:*** Adversarial Robustness, Graph Neural Networks, Adaptive Attacks

***TL;DR:*** Adaptive evaluation reveals that most examined adversarial defenses for GNNs show no or only marginal improvement in robustness
The paper suggests that non-adaptive attacks lead to an overstate on adversarial robustness, and thus the authors recommend using adaptive attacks as a gold-standard.

***TL;DR:*** A novel adversarial defense for image classification is proposed with the use of the local implicit functions. (This paper provides a way, named aDversarIal defenSe with local impliCit functiOns (DISCO), to protect classifiers from being attacked by adversarial examples. DISCO is composed of two parts: an encoder and a local implicit module. For inference, DISCO takes an image (either clean or adversarially perturbed) and a query pixel location as input and outputs an RGB value that is as clean as possible. After the process, the new output image is expected to wipe out all the adversarial perturbation on it, making the classifier predicts with high accuracy. In summary, I think that DISCO is one type of denoising model that aims to be adversarially robust.)

***Keywords:*** memorization, privacy, auditing, membership inference attack

***TL;DR:*** Removing the layer of outlier points that are most vulnerable to a privacy attack exposes a new layer of previously-safe points to the attack
This paper examines the impact of removing records that are most vulnerable to a membership inference attack on the privacy of the remaining records. Given a machine learning model trained on a private dataset, one way to make it more “privacy-preserving” without randomizing the training algorithm could be to identify records at risk, remove them from the dataset, then re-train a model on the remaining records. The paper shows that some of the remaining records become more at risk and investigates potential causes for this phenomenon.

***Keywords:*** Backdoor Defense, Pre-trained Language Models

***TL;DR:*** In this paper, the authors investigate an interesting phenomenon that when the models are doing a moderate fitting with parameter-efficient training methods, the models are likely to ignore the backdoored features, as those features are ill-trained. Based on this observation, the authors suggest restricting the language model fine-tuning to the moderate-fitting stage to naturally improve the robustness of language models against backdoor triggers. Furthermore, the authors find that (1) parameter capacity, (2) training epochs, and (3) learning rate are key factors that can impact the models’ vulnerability to backdoors. Reducing those hyper-parameters can help models fail to adapt to backdoor features.

***TL;DR:*** The paper studies the problem of enhancing neural network robustness from a dynamic system perspective.

In this way, the asymptotic stability will reduce the adversarial noise to bring the nearby adversarial examples close to the clean instance. The empirical studies show that the proposed method can defend against existing attacks and outperform SOTA defense methods.

(The paper presents an interesting and novel analysis for an important problem of understanding why standard gradient-based training can lead to non-robust models, although robust models provably exist. The paper nicely points out that margin maximization in the parameter space is not aligned in general with the L2 robustness. Moreover, I think the paper is an interesting contribution towards the discussion of adversarial examples being “bugs vs. features” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175) where the authors of the current paper give theoretical evidence that adversarial examples can also arise as “bugs” from the particular optimization algorithm we use for training.)

***TL;DR:*** we develop an adversarial augmentation based method that combines new task samples with memory buffer samples for continual learning, which can be applied with general continual learning methods such as ER, MIR, etc. to achieve improved performance
(The paper proposes a novel approach to tackle the classifier bias problem in the context of continual learning. For this purpose, the approach (called RAR) focusses on the examplars that are close to the the forgetting border. RAR perturbs the selected exemplars towards the closest sample from the current task in the latent space. By replaying such samples, RAR is able to refine the boundary between previous and current tasks, hence combating forgetting and reducing bias towards the current task. Moreover, the authors propose to combine RAR with the mix-up technique which significantly improves continual learning in the small buffer regime. RAR is a generic approach and could be combined with any experience replay method.)

(In this work, the authors constrain adversarial perturbations to the space of object and camera pose that lead to poor visual recognition performance. Importantly, the space considered is constrained to be physically plausible. They leverage recent advances in Neural Rendering (NeRF) to generate realistic 3D models of objects, and optimize for non-canonical poses that lead to poor predictive performance. Finally, the authors propose a new benchmark for evaluating viewpoint robustness (ImageNet-V) which may be used to assess the general quality of any image recognition system.)

***TL;DR:*** We perform a large scale empirical study of out-of-distribution generalization. (This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of deep neural networks’ Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization on visual recognition tasks. The main motivation is that previous studies for OOD generalization consider specific types of distributional shifts and are evaluated with specific datasets and architectures, and thus the conclusion drawn from one setting may not generalize to another. To overcome such limitations, the authors perform large-scale experiments under diverse types of OOD data on 172 ID/OOD datasets with multiple architectures. The experimental results show that some of the conclusions drawn from previous small-scale works do not hold in general and may depend on the target tasks, and that the factor that is consistently correlated with the OOD performance is the model’s ID performance.)

***Keywords:*** adversarial robustness, robustness, adversarial attack, Adversarial Robustness Evaluations

***TL;DR:*** We propose a test that enables researchers to find flawed adversarial robustness evaluations. Passing our test produces compelling evidence that the attacks used have sufficient power to evaluate the model’s robustness. (This paper proposes a binarization test to identify weak attacks against adversarial example defenses. The proposed test changes the model’s prediction layer to a binary classifier and fine-tunes it on a small crafted dataset for each benign example. As a result, the original attack, if sufficiently strong, should be able to find adversarial examples when applied to the modified model. This test serves as an active robustness test to complement existing passive tests of weak attacks. )
